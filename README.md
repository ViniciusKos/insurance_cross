**Disclaimer**: this project was inspired by the "Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction" challenge published on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction?sort=votes). Although it is a fictitious project it will follow all steps of a real project.

## Business Issue
Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

## Solution methodology
The resolution of the challenge was carried out following the CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for data mining) methodology, which is a cyclical approach that streamlines the delivery of value to the business through fast and valuable MVPs.

Benefits of Using CRISP-DM
This method is cost-effective as it includes a number of processes to take out simple data mining tasks.
CRISP-DM encourages best practices and allows projects to replicate.
This methodology provides a uniform framework for planning and managing a project.
Being cross-industry standard, CRISP-DM can be implemented in any Data Science project irrespective of its domain.
